# SSH Key Auto-Generation Module
#
# This module automatically generates SSH keys on new machines if they don't exist.
# This eliminates the manual step of running ssh-keygen on each new machine.
#
# Features:
# - Generates Ed25519 key (modern, secure, fast)
# - Only generates if key doesn't already exist
# - Sets correct permissions automatically
# - Uses hostname-based comment for identification
#
# After key generation:
#   1. View your public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
#   2. Add it to services.sshAuthorizedKeys.keys in your instance flake
#   3. Commit to your instance flake to enable SSH access from other machines
#
# Security:
#   - Keys are generated locally on each machine
#   - Private keys never leave the machine
#   - No passphrase (for automation - add one manually if needed)
