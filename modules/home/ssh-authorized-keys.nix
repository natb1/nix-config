# SSH Authorized Keys Management Module
#
# This module manages ~/.ssh/authorized_keys from a list of public-key strings
# supplied via `services.sshAuthorizedKeys.keys`. This enables:
#
# - Centralized key management in version control
# - Automatic key distribution across all machines
# - Easy access revocation (remove key from the option value, rebuild)
# - Audit trail of who has access
#
# Usage:
#   1. Set `services.sshAuthorizedKeys.keys` to a list of public-key strings
#      in the shared home configuration (modules/home/default.nix).
#   2. Run: home-manager switch
#   3. Your authorized_keys file is updated automatically!
#
# The option defaults to null (unset), which is inert: no key material, no
# write to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and any pre-existing file is left untouched.
# Setting it to an explicit list — including the empty list `[ ]` — is
# authoritative: the file is rewritten to exactly those keys, so `[ ]` clears
# it and revokes all access (see "Easy access revocation" above).
#
# Security:
#   - Only PUBLIC keys should be supplied via this option
#   - Private keys remain on each machine, never synced
#   - authorized_keys file permissions are automatically set to 600
